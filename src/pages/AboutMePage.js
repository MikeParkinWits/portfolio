                Hi, I'm Michael Parkin, a recent graduate with a degree in
                Digital Arts - majoring in game, and interactive media, design.
                Through my degree, I found my passion for designing good user
                experiences and have gained experience in numerous areas such as
                UI/UX design, front-end development, and game design.
              </p>
              <p className="body-text">
                I am currently seeking to further this passion by pursuing a
                masters degree in Human-Comptuer Interaction. I am excited to
                see what the future holds, and am eager to work with a team of
                like-minded individuals to create innovative and engaging
                digital experiences.
              </p>

                Out of the classroom youâ€™ll find me playing board games, taking
                photos, and petting all the good dogs.
