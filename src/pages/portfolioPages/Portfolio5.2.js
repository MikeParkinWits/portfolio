                    <p>
                      In South Africa, the experience of on-street parking can
                      turn stressful quickly. Finding an open parking spot seems
                      easy, but returning to your car often involves dealing
                      with informal 'car guards' soliciting money. What should
                      have been a simple process turns into a potentially
                      awkward encounter, disrupting the usual in-and-out
                      routine.

                      Self-proclaimed 'car guards' in South Africa are
                      unreliable, often intoxicated, and offer minimal theft
                      protection. Their presence poses safety risks, especially
                      for solo female drivers at night, raising concerns about
                      reliability. This unique issue in South Africa remains
                      unexplored.

                    Although off-street parking solutions like KaChing and Admyt
                    promote 'ticketless entry,' they frequently face issues with
                    malfunctioning AI cameras, forcing users to revert to
                    traditional ticket systems.

                      Self-proclaimed 'car guards' in South Africa are
                      unreliable, often intoxicated, and offer minimal theft
                      protection. Their presence poses safety risks, especially
                      for solo female drivers at night, raising concerns about
                      reliability. This unique issue in South Africa remains

                  for innovation in the on-street parking landscape in South

                  I then used these low-fidelity wireframes, along with feedback
                  sessions to develop a set of high-fidelity wireframes.
                  Thereafter, Swift & SwiftUI were used to turn those
                  high-fidelity wireframes into a working prototype, which was
                  seen in the video earlier.

                  was able to land on an innovative solution to a problem that

                  am happy with the solution I developed, during final user
                  testing there were a handful of suggestions given for further
                  improvement. These include:

                    While the discounted evaluation provides valuable feedback,
                    I should consider expanding the user testing pool to include
                    a more diverse demographic, ensuring a broader
                    representation of potential users. This could uncover
                    additional insights and perspectives that may influence the
                    final design.

                    design language that was more unique and had its own brand
