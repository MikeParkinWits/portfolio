                <p>
                  In South Africa, the experience of on-street parking can turn
                  stressful quickly. Finding an open parking spot seems easy,
                  but returning to your car often involves dealing with informal
                  'car guards' soliciting money. What should have been a simple
                  process turns into a potentially awkward encounter, disrupting
                  the usual in-and-out routine.

                    environment for everyone involved?

                <p>
                  Self-proclaimed 'car guards' in South Africa are generally
                  unreliable, often intoxicated, and provide minimal protection
                  against theft. Their presence can create unsafe situations,
                  particularly for solo female drivers at night, raising
                  concerns about confronting strangers and the reliability of
                  these guards. It is a problem unique to South Africa, and as
                  such one unexplored.
                </p>

                  everyone.

                  Firstly, including all possible stakeholders in the design

                  To better understand how to improve the on-street parking

                  I started the user research with{" "}
                  <b className="bio-bold">surveys</b> aimed at capturing a broad
                  understanding of the prevailing issues with on-street parking
                  in South Africa. To do this, I was able to reach 42
                  participants from diverse backgrounds and regions within South
                  Africa, with the goal of understanding the frequency and
                  nature of interactions with informal 'car guards.' Key survey
                  questions explored the perceived safety concerns, reliability
                  of these guards, and the impact on the overall parking
                  experience. The responses were analyzed and findings are

                <p className="sub-head-p">
                  Next, recognizing the limitations of surveys in capturing

                  <b className="bio-bold">

                  to delve deeper into the qualitative aspects of the on-street
                  parking scenario. Through this, I engaged with a group of 4
                  participants, including frequent drivers and female drivers
                  who often travel alone at night. The interviews unveiled a
                  series of emotional and experiential dimensions of the
                  problem, which I go into more depth in my findings section
                  later.

                  Competitive Analysis
                </h4>
                <p className="sub-head-p">
                  After looking through the research data, which focused on the
                  on-street parking experiences in general, I performed a
                  competitive analysis of other parking services and systems in
                  South Africa. While I considered looking at similair
                  international services, I decided that given the cultural
                  differences that it would not be worthwhile. All of this then
                  resulted in three competitors being identified in the space at
                  the time: two off-street parking services,{" "}
                  <b className="bio-bold">KaChing</b> and{" "}
                  <b className="bio-bold">Admyt</b>; and one on-street parking
                  service, <b className="bio-bold">ParkFind</b>.
                </p>
                <p className="sub-head-p">
                  Having performed a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Oppurtunities,
                  Threats) analysis of these competitors, it can be noted that
                  none of these apps or services have take off in South Africa.
                  This can mainly be attributed to one problem: they add an
                  extra step of complexity to the parking process, as opposed to
                  simplifying it. All of the currently available solutions try
                  to provide a solution to a problem that never really existed.
                  For example, with off-street parking KaChing & Admyt both
                  advertise ‚Äòticketless entry‚Äô at parking bays - where instead
                  of taking a ticket the service uses AI cameras to admit you
                  upon approaching the parking lot. However, these cameras are
                  often broken, requiring the driver to take a ticket
                  nonetheless - adding another thing for the driver to worry
                  about. With the on-street parking app ParkFind, it has some
                  major flaws. Instead of trying to revolutionise on-street
                  parking, its actual goal was merely to modernise parking
                  meters. As such, it takes all the headaches that parking
                  meters present ‚Äî having to pre-emptively choose your parking
                  duration, limited parking hours, and pre-existing equipment
                  required ‚Äî and links that to a mobile application. Thus,
                  through a competitive analysis we can see that there is still
                  a large amount of room to grow and explore.

                  Based on the research and design requirements listed, I then
                  performed a brainstorming session on FigJam to develop
                  potential solutions to this problem - which can be seen below.
                  Thereafter, I went through each idea and tried to combine, and
                  filter them into the best ones. From this, I then ultimately
                  landed on the idea of{" "}

                    creating a SaaS application that connects drivers to

                  With a design solution chosen, I then went on to develop a

                <p className="sub-head-p">
                  Using Figma, I then developed a series of low-fidelity
                  wireframes for the driver application. It is important to note
                  that like other SaaS applications, Parker requires a customer
                  (the driver) and provider (the car guard) applications, but{" "}

                  I then used these low-fidelity wireframes, along with feedback
                  sessions to develop a set of high-fidelity wireframes.
                  Thereafter, Swift & SwiftUI were used to turn those
                  high-fidelity wireframes into a working prototype, which was
                  seen working in the video earlier. These can be seen alongside
                  each other in an interactable Figma window below.
