                    <p>
                      In South Africa, the experience of on-street parking can
                      turn stressful quickly. Finding an open parking spot seems
                      easy, but returning to your car often involves dealing
                      with informal 'car guards' soliciting money. What should
                      have been a simple process turns into a potentially
                      awkward encounter, disrupting the usual in-and-out
                      routine.

                      Self-proclaimed 'car guards' in South Africa are
                      unreliable, often intoxicated, and offer minimal theft
                      protection. Their presence poses safety risks, especially
                      for solo female drivers at night, raising concerns about
                      reliability. This unique issue in South Africa remains
                      unexplored.

                  From the research performed, there is clearly a pressing need
                  for innovation in the on-street parking landscape in South
                  Africa. Users crave a solution that not only ensures safety
                  and reliability but also addresses the emotional impact of the
                  current system. The integration of a cashless transaction
                  system, enhanced safety measures, and a user-friendly
                  interface emerged as key priorities for improving the
                  on-street parking experience in South Africa. These insights
                  will guide the development of a solution that aligns with the
                  unique needs and challenges faced by drivers in the region.

                  In a discounted evaluation, I made use of{" "}
                  <b className="bio-bold">task-based testing</b>, alongside a{" "}
                  <b className="bio-bold"> semi-structured interview</b> to test
                  my design solution and prototype. I conducted all of the tests
                  with 2 participants in their mid 20s. All participants had a
                  driver's license and were familair with the problem space.
                  Throughout testing, I also asked users to{" "}
                  <b className="bio-bold">think aloud</b>. The{" "}
                  <b className="bio-bold">task scenarios</b> used to test this
                  were:

                    Imagine you are out and have used on-street parking. How

                    <b className="bio-bold">Rationale:</b> The first task
                    scenario aims to cover the primary purpose of the app,
                    seeing if users know and understand how to perform one of
                    its main actions.

                  Overall, I believe that through the process outlined above, I
                  was able to land on an innovative solution to a problem that
                  is evident on a daily basis to South African drivers. While I
                  am happy with the solution I developed, during final user
                  testing there were a handful of suggestions given for further
                  improvement. These include:

                      Diversify User Testing Demographics:

                    While the discounted evaluation provides valuable feedback,
                    I should consider expanding the user testing pool to include
                    a more diverse demographic, ensuring a broader
                    representation of potential users. This could uncover
                    additional insights and perspectives that may influence the
                    final design.

                    While users noted the app was easy to use and presented a
                    minimalist aesthetic, users advised designing a visual
                    design language that was more unique and had its own brand
                    identity.

                      Integrate More Deeply with Private Security Companies:

                    In South Africa, private security companies are extremely
                    popular. Users would have liked to see a deeper integration
                    with these companies when a car guard is watching their
                    vehicle.
