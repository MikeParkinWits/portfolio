Overview and Intent</h2><p><cite>The Internet We Know</cite> is an interactive piece of net art created to critique the increasingly dark design practices that are present on many modern-day websites, practices that we often ignore as we have become extremely desensitized towards them. To do this, I aimed to create a blog/news website, focusing on issues in the web, which acted as the canvas for my artwork; subverting the users preconceived, desensitized, expectations by taking these bad practices and pushing them to their extreme and mocking them, in an attempt to bring awareness to their true intentions. Below I have outlined the process for how I went about creating this internet artwork, and the reasons behind my decisions.</p><h2 class="portfolio-page-heading-1">2. Process</h2><p>First, I began my process by explore various different modern websites in order to understand where to start with my idea; and while I came across multiple different areas that I could have explored, one in particular stood out to me the most, as it is an area that has become normalized but should not be – cookie consent popups. To understand why these should not be normalized, however, we must first understand what cookies are. According to Kaspersky Antivirus, cookies are a small piece of identifying information that is saved to your browser, allowing information to be retained between browsing sessions. Although, while these may be useful, with first party cookies from the website you are visiting used to keep you logged in and remember your preferences; they are often abused through third party cookies, which are used to track your movement on the web – serving you more accurate, and increasingly creepier, advertisements in addition unwanted spam. As such, governments around the world have begun implementing laws to combat this – with one of the most prominent being the ePrivacy Directive put in place by the EU in 2002, which requires websites to ask for consent before using cookies. Although, while this may appear to be a good idea on the surface, loose wording, and very little enforcement, has led to it being grossly abused and misused. In the law, it states that the methods for giving information, offering a right to refuse or requesting consent, should be made as user-friendly as possible; however, many websites have taken this liberally, which has resulted in websites making use of dark UI/UX patterns – which Arushi Jaiswal, in their article Dark patterns in UX, notes are deceptive UI/UX interactions that are designed to mislead and trick users – to make accepting cookie usage easy, but declining it extremely difficult.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.1. Dark UI/UX Patterns</h3><p>As such, I started by focusing on this idea of using dark UI/UX patterns, alongside satirical phrasing, to bring attention to the abusive nature of cookie consent law. To do this, I began by placing a simple cookie consent banner at the bottom of my website, purposefully adjusting the colours of the buttons for ‘accept all’ and ‘update preferences’ to make users perceive the ‘accept all’ button as the right option – with the accept all button being an extremely bright, and friendly, colour; as opposed to the dull, and slightly opaque, colours of the ‘update preferences’ button. In addition to this, the cookie consent banner also makes use of more satirical, literal, information as to why the website needs you to accept the cookies. This is then juxtaposed next to the, often-vague, information claiming cookies provide an enhanced user experience, with a line struck through the true reason the developers want you to accept their cookies. However, it is important to note that while crossed out text usual signifies text that should not be read, by placing it in a space that seldom has this, it actually stands out more and users are more inclined to engage with it (see figure 5 below). Similarly, this same dark UI/UX pattern can also been seen throughout the entire site – with the ‘adjust preferences’ popup making use of the same crossed out text and button colour schemes. In addition to this, I also take it a step further – using an even more abusive, but still legal, dark UI/UX pattern – placing a cookie wall at the front of the website that requires users to disable cookie blockers if enabled (see figure 6 below); as well as encouraging the user to re-evaluate their cookie choices later if they did not accept them all when first updating their cookie preferences. These then act as a physical barrier to the user, putting a major emphasis on how easily these cookie consent popups can be abused, while still technically being legal, and why they should not be normalized.</p><section class="portfolio-double-figures"><figure class="portfolio-figure"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/Image1.d5ee326b599e8b563a07.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Figure 1: A screenshot of my websites cookie banner</figcaption></figure><figure class="portfolio-figure"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/Image2.e66209615fde07f56b4e.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Figure 2: A screenshot of my website if cookies are blocked</figcaption></figure></section><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.2. Forced Continuity and Action</h3><p>Next, I then looked at how I could expand upon these ideas to better reach my desired goal, which led to my next idea – utilizing forced continuity and action. According to Dheeraj Khindri, in their 2021 article 10 Common Dark Patterns in UX and How to Avoid Them, forced continuity and action is, for example, when you need to enter your email to continue using a website or an app – such as The New York Times requiring you to login just to read an article. So, while many may be unfamiliar with the term, most have experienced forced action in some shape or form on the internet, becoming desensitized to it as a result. However, when looking more closely at it, the question may arise as to why websites even require you to login if something is free. The answer: while the content is monetarily free, you are paying for it with your personal data, and at the expense of your own privacy – as websites are allowed to do with your data as they please. So, for my internet artwork I decided to create a popup that requires the user to login after they have read just one blog post, acknowledging that they are providing the website with their personal data, with no way to ignore this request – similar to that of The New York Times forced action. However, through the previously mentioned satirical phrasing and extremely abusive appearance, the user is then made more aware of the developer’s true intentions for including this artificial limitation on the website. In addition to this, it is important to note that the login/logout process for the website also makes use of its own deceptive design, the roach motel – which is a process whereby providing information is easy, but relinquishing access to it is difficult. So, while logging in only requires a single button click, logging out presents an additional popup which tries to persuade the user to not log out – utilizing the same button colours and layout as the cookie banner, with no appearing as the ‘correct’ option.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.3. Minimalism</h3><p>Lastly, we then reach the final design goal for the game – minimalism. Although minimalism was only a minor design goal for the game, it was still something I considered extremely seriously throughout the project. However, minimalism is an extremely broad term and as such I broke it down into three parts: visual, audio, and user interface.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.4. Web Notifications</h3><p>Thereafter, I looked to the next normalized aspect of websites that I wanted to shed light on through my internet artwork – web notifications. While their introduction to the web was logical and useful, providing users with relevant information without having to constantly check the site, they quickly began to be misused because of their loose permission principles and ability to draw users attention – such as through advertisements and spam content at any time. As a result, many people accept them assuming they will enhance their experience, unaware of how to block them later once they are no longer beneficial and misused. So, for my website I designed push notifications which are sent frequently throughout while viewing the site, with the goal of distracting users whilst they read blog posts – taking the types of ad and spams that normally get sent through browser notifications, making them appear more frequently and being extremely satirical. However, I quickly ran into an issue while creating this aspect of the internet artwork. With notification spam becoming a big issue in recent years, not only do less people accept push notifications; but browsers, and operating systems, have begun giving the user the option to block all notifications system wide. As such, this could make my internet artwork less effective – with no way to alter this from the website. So, to counter this I made it so that if the user has blocked notifications, or does not accept push notifications, an in-browser notification appears to still make the push notifications abuse noticeable.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.5. Confirm Shaming</h3><p>Although, while I had intended to stop my net art with those three areas, I soon realized that my net art did not affect the users experience of the entire website – as most of the net art only appeared at the very beginning of a user’s journey on my site. As such, I implemented one final deceptive design, confirm shamming – which is the process of using emotional manipulation to make a user signup for something or provide personal information (ibid.). In the case of my website, midway through the site the user is prompted to join the websites mailing list. Not only is this artificial gateway placed on the user’s experience, but by using confirm shaming, the option for no is turned into “no thanks, I don't want to be a front runner in web development” – shaming the user into subscribing to the websites mailing list. However, unlike traditional confirm shaming, on subscribing the user is emailed to inform them about confirm shaming and to teach them about these tactics so that they can be more aware.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.6. Final Touches</h3><p>Lastly, with all of the features of my internet artwork now in place, I included one simple, yet extremely effective, final piece to it – the ability to toggle the internet artwork on and off using a button in the footer of the website. While this may seem unnecessary to some, granting the user the ability to disable the internet artwork is vital – as it allows the user to experience the website without any distractions, making it clear just how badly deceptive design tactics impact a websites usability and experience. Ultimately, this option then helps to highlight the importance of becoming re-sensitized to these deceptive design principles across the web, and brings us one step closer to outlawing them as a collective.</p><h2 class="portfolio-page-heading-1">3. Reflection</h2><p>So, in conclusion, I am happy with the net art that I was able to create, and believe that I was successfully able to achieve my goal of re-sensitizing users to aspects of the web that had become normalized, but should not have been – with every decision made while creating this internet artwork extremely deliberate. However, even though I am happy with how the artwork turned out, and see it as a success, there were still areas where I felt it could have been improved. I found that my implementation of a notification system did not meet my overall expectations and was not as effective as I expected – as it turns out companies have been putting external measures in place to reduce notification spamming. While unfortunate for my internet artwork, it shows how companies are slowly becoming more aware of these deceptive design principles and are trying to stop them, which ultimately aligns with the goal of my internet artwork.</p></section></article></article></main><footer class="main-footer h-card"><section class="main-footer-contents"><p class="p-name">Michael Parkin</p><p>|</p><time datetime="2023">2023</time></section><section class="secondary-footer-contents"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-parkin-a43349169/" target="_blank"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" data-testid="LinkedInIcon" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h14m-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93h2.79M6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37h2.77z"></path></svg></a></section></footer></div></body></html>
