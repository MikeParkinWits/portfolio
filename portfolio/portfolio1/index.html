Overview and Intent</h2><p><cite>Swing</cite> is a simple - 2D - arcade game I created in two weeks. While brainstorming for this game, I kept coming back to the idea of creating a small game with a simple main mechanic that felt extremely satisfying to use and evoked a sense of relaxation throughout. In Swing, the player uses a grappling hook to swing around and traverse an infinite game world where they attach to various geometric shapes to do so. The player is then encouraged to swing quickly and smoothly while simultaneously not colliding into any of the shapes to increase their score.</p><p>To achieve this effect, I set out three design goals, all of which aid in creating the aesthetic quality of submission – as defined by Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek in their MDA Framework. Firstly, I wanted the game to make use of one simple main mechanic that could be picked up at any time without a huge learning curve. This simplicity would then allow for a greater level of refinement to ensure that the main mechanic feels smooth and relaxing to use. Secondly, I wanted to create a gameplay loop that allowed for the single mechanic to be fully explored while simultaneously helping create a sense of calmness for the player as they traversed the game world. Lastly, I wanted the game to be extremely minimalistic so that all aspects of design and tutorialization would be critically analyzed, only displaying necessary elements to enhance the gameplay experience.</p><h2 class="portfolio-page-heading-1">2. Process</h2><p>Although, just because the game is designed to be simple and minimalist does not mean the process was simple – in fact, the simplicity of the project required that I evaluate each element and design choice more critically. As such, we can now start to look at the process behind Swing’s creation – using the three main design goals as success criteria:</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.1. Simple, Single, Main Mechanic</h3><p>As stated earlier, my intention was to create a single, easy-to-use, main mechanic that felt extremely satisfying to use – evoking a sense of relaxation throughout play. While brainstorming ideas for this main mechanic, I kept coming back to one extremely smooth, and satisfying, mechanic – the web swinging ability from Spiderman for PS4. As such, I thought about ways that I could create a game around this type of ability. However, I knew that creating a full 3D game to do this would be extremely over scoped for my timeline. As a result, I also took inspiration from other smaller games that revolve around smooth feeling mechanics – such as the infinite arcade game One More Line. This then ultimately led to the game main mechanic of a grappling hook, which players would then use to swing around an infinite gameworld. Importantly though, in order to align with the design goals, I needed to make sure that the grappling and swinging felt extremely smooth and refined. As such, the grapple was designed to smoothly wrap around corners and have ample room to be refined through rigorous external playtesting.</p><p>However, before I could start refining the feel of the mechanic, I first needed to decide the most appropriate control scheme for it – allowing for the simple mechanic to feel as intuitive as possible. To do this, I made use of Andrew Dotsenko’s 2017 blog post Designing Game Controls to create four different control schemes for the game, each taking into account Dotsenko’s three main principles of accessibility, intent communication, and expression space. Firstly, there is the <strong>mixed mouse button</strong>control scheme, which requires the player to make three movements per one action – moving the mouse to select an attach direction, left clicking to attach the grapple, and right clicking to detach the grapple. Secondly, we have the<string>single mouse button</string>control scheme, which is similar to the previous control scheme except the player only uses two separate movements per action – using the mouse to select your attach direction, and the left mouse button to both attach, by clicking and holding, and detach, by letting go. Thirdly, there is the <strong>mouse and keyboard</strong> control scheme, which is similar to the previous, except it replaces the left mouse button with the spacebar on the keyboard, allowing the right hand to act solely as the direction indicator. Lastly, there is <strong>keyboard only</strong> control scheme, which is the simplest control scheme and only requires one movement per action. Like the previous control scheme, the player still uses the space button to attach and detach, but the direction is determined by a rotating arrow around the player – with this final control scheme intended to test how the game would function on mobile.</p><p>With these control schemes set, I then performed various formal, and informal, playtests – where the results were unanimous – providing a clear favorite. Playtesters preferred the intuitive and natural controls of the single mouse button control scheme (control scheme two), as it mimicked the action of attaching and detaching occurring on screen. This is in contrast to the least favorite control scheme, the mixed mouse button control scheme (control scheme one), as it required a higher cognitive load and was not representative of the mechanic on-screen. When playtesting, players also noted that they much preferred the precision of the control schemes on PC, and so I decided to continue development there.</p><p>With the control scheme now selected, I could begin refining the controls of the mechanic itself. Through more informal playtesting, I began tweaking various elements – such as the amount of pull the grapple has when attaching, how quickly it grapples, how quickly it swings, the gravity scale, and more. By doing this, I was then able to create a mechanic that felt smooth and satisfying to use, giving players adequate control over the mechanic, allow them to traverse smoothly through the gameworld and reach a sense of relaxation.</p><p>With the main mechanic completed to a satisfactory level, I then began implementing a secondary mechanic to encourage the player to keep moving and swing quickly throughout the level – a high score counter. When the player is traversing the gameworld, they rack up points relative to their velocity however, when the player collides with an object their score would reset. While secondary mechanics are never necessary in a game, when implemented successfully they can greatly increase the ease of gameplay – and through informal playtesting I saw that this addition was extremely well received, both helping to give players an objective, while still being unobtrusive enough for those that just wanted to enjoy the relaxing feel of the game.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.2. Effective Gameplay Loop</h3><p>With that, we can then start to look at how I implemented my second design goal – an effective and engaging gameplay loop. As stated earlier, I wanted the world to be infinite to allow the player to fully explore the core grappling and swinging mechanic, while still allowing for consistent engagement. As such, I started to playtest a cursory infinite world to see how players traversed it, noticing that players reacted positively to successfully performing different stunts. Thus, I then knew that there needed to be different ways for players to express themselves with the main mechanic. This then led to the creation of an infinite world that was seemingly random, but completely intentional – using pseudorandom level generation, consisting of two different types of predefined templates, to give the player different areas to perform stunts and gain points.</p><p>The first of these templates is the spawn point template, which spawn a random selection of the game’s shapes in eight pre-defined grid patterns (as seen below in figure 1) – with each shaping shape spawning in a random rotation on the grid. This randomness then ultimately helps to introduce endless scenarios for play, while still being controlled through the various pre-defined spawn patterns for the objects – making sure that the player never gets stuck. Secondly, there are the prebuilt area templates, where I created seven specific ‘showpiece’ scenarios to allow the player to express themselves freely through a pre-defined area (as seen below in figure 2). These two types of templates then complimented each other well, with the prebuilt area templates balancing out the randomness of the spawn point templates – allowing for a satisfying gameplay experience consisting of smoother, and faster, traversal. However, I had to make sure that the starting area for the world was always the same – as this allows for a consistent, and stable, starting point whenever beginning the game.</p><section class="portfolio-double-figures"><figure class="portfolio-figure"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/Image1.dd78b2442dfda4b55ac1.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Figure 1: An example of one of the eight different spawn point templates available, where the yellow dots indicate the spawn points of objects.</figcaption></figure><figure class="portfolio-figure"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/Image2.da028be1bd32abce57c1.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Figure 2: An example of one of the different prebuilt are templates available</figcaption></figure></section><p>Thereafter, we looked at how to spawn these different templates throughout play. It was extremely important to me that when generating these templates, they do two things: spawn out of sight from the player, as not to break the players submission to the game; and delete themselves once they are no longer necessary, so that the game can run infinitely without any system bottleneck from unnecessary objects. However, during playtesting I also realized that I needed to further adjust, and balance, how these templates spawn. Initially, all the templates had an equal chance of spawning, but I soon noticed that while players enjoyed all the template designs, certain templates appearing too often was frustrating for the player, and as such I balanced the spawn rate of different templates – spawning the templates that players enjoyed the most more often.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.3. Minimalism</h3><p>Lastly, we then reach the final design goal for the game – minimalism. Although minimalism was only a minor design goal for the game, it was still something I considered extremely seriously throughout the project. However, minimalism is an extremely broad term and as such I broke it down into three parts: visual, audio, and user interface.</p><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">2.3.1. Visuals</h4><p>When it comes to the visuals, I had tested various designs. As creating a smooth gameplay experience was important to me, I initially created grey level objects that were rounded and allowed for the player to smoothly wrap around them when swinging. However, I soon noticed that this confused players, especially when moving at high speeds, as the shapes blurred into each other and had no discernible attach points – taking away from both the games design goals and the player experience. Thus, I decided to make the level objects both more colourful, to help them stand out against the white background; and some sharper, to differentiate them from the round player – creating a good visual hierarchy for the player, while also providing a smoother world traversal. Although, instead of merely assigning random colours or a single colour palette for all the objects, I decided to implement a rotating collection of different colour palettes for objects, with the goal of creating engaging visuals that add to the replayability and endless nature of the game (as seen in figures 3 and 4 below).</p><section class="portfolio-double-figures"><figure class="portfolio-figure"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/Image3.6dc0b7f7ff4ec663e6ab.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Figure 3: An example of the red colour scheme in the game</figcaption></figure><figure class="portfolio-figure"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/Image4.b4fdec76f10a33115a3b.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Figure 4: An example of the blue colour scheme in the game</figcaption></figure></section><p>However, just because I was aiming for minimalism did not mean I sacrificed functionality and communication design. As such, there were two areas where I implemented additional layered visual feedback. Firstly, I added a trail renderer to the ball that appears when the player swings, as I found that this helps to better convey the speed, and direction, of the player while simultaneously being more visually pleasing. Secondly, I found that during playtesting players failed to understand that their current scores reset when hitting objects, and believed that they were just being reset at random. As such, I implemented a further layer of communication design to indicate to the player that colliding into objects causes the reset.</p><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">2.3.2. Audio</h4><p>Next, we can look at the audio design of Swing which, while simple, has been thought out thoroughly. As I wanted the game to be relaxing and satisfying, I made sure that only the necessary and useful audio effects were added, so not distract the player during gameplay. This resulted in sound effects only being found in three places: when attaching the grapple hook, colliding with an object, and breaking your high score. On top of this, I also decided to implement soothing background music to add to my goal of making the game relaxing. Although, I understood that to increase relaxation players may want to listen to their own music while playing and as such, I also gave the player the option of muting this background music while still receiving audio feedback for actions.</p><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">2.3.3. Interface</h4><p>However, the minimalist design does not stop at audio and visuals, as I carried it forward to the user interface – as I did not want it taking away from the overall gameplay experience. As such, I only displayed the most necessary UI elements, placing them in places that were both familiar and unobtrusive – with the pause and restart button on the top right, and the player’s score information on top left. By only utilizing the corners of the screen I was then able to take up as little space, and cognitive load, as possible. Furthering this, I also made sure that the pause menu was as simple as possible, using symbols instead of words as they are more readable at a glance. However, I found that when players left the pause menu it would be extremely jarring to be thrown right back into the game directly, sometimes causing them to lose their current score as a result. As such, I implemented a short three second count down timer to allow the player to see where they are placed before they start swinging again.</p><p>Furthermore, although the games single mechanic is designed to be simple and intuitive to use, I felt it was still necessary to add some sort of tutorialization to teach the player how to play, in the case that they do not figure it out on their own. Thus, I added an element within the game at the very start of the game which plays a basic animation on screen, indicating that pressing the left mouse button will let them attach to objects.</p><h2 class="portfolio-page-heading-1">3. Reflection</h2><p>Lastly, we can now reflect on the final game prototype that I created. Overall, through the process that I have outlined above, I believe that I was able to successfully meet the intent and design goals of a simple game that uses a refined single mechanic, engrossing gameplay, and sense of minimalism to create the core aesthetic quality of submission and relaxation throughout gameplay. Through this process I then ultimately learnt that even a simple mechanic, such as grappling and swinging, should be playtested thoroughly in order to have a refined gameplay experience – which shows how every aspect of future games should be playtested, and refined, thoroughly.</p><p>However, as much as I believe that I did successfully meet my design goals, I understand that there are places that I could improve for future. While I believe that the games main mechanic did feel extremely smooth and satisfying to use, I know that with more time and playtesting I could have refined it even further. Not only that, but I would have also liked to perform more playtests on the procedural level generation, testing the different templates I created as to prevent any unforeseen situations – as I know that there were a multitude of situations which could still arise. Lastly, there were various features that I had planned to implement, but ended up abandoning because of both time, and straying too far from the games original design goals and intent. An example of this is a currency system, where coins are scattered around the game world in tricky spots, requiring more proficiency of the main mechanic to acquire. Players could then use these coins to purchase mechanical modifications, such as speed changes and grappling adjustments. While I felt that implementing this feature would add to the arcade aspect of the game, I realized that it would detract from the submission aesthetic, and therefore chose to not implement it in the final prototype as it did not align fully with my design goals.</p></section></article></article></main><footer class="main-footer h-card"><section class="main-footer-contents"><p class="p-name">Michael Parkin</p><p>|</p><time datetime="2023">2023</time></section><section class="secondary-footer-contents"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-parkin-a43349169/" target="_blank"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" data-testid="LinkedInIcon" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h14m-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93h2.79M6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37h2.77z"></path></svg></a></section></footer></div></body></html>
