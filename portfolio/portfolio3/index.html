Overview and Intent</h2><p><cite>Braai Simulator</cite> is a 3D, first-person, life simulation game that I created for my 3rd year final university project. We were split into random teams of two and tasked with conceptualizing and creating a game prototype over the course of two months. Throughout this process, I took the position of project manager, lead developer, and lead game designer; while my partner oversaw all aspects of the game’s visuals.</p><p>In the game, the player takes on the role of a braai/barbeque host with one goal: keep their hungry guests satisfied all night long. To do this, the player must use the available utensils to pick up food and place it on the braai to cook. When cooked, it must then be plated and taken to their hungry guests. However, the player must be careful not to burn food by cooking it for too long. Doing this risks a guest being served burnt food or not receiving a meal, which ultimately lowers the overall satisfaction of the party. If the night reaches an end, and the guest satisfaction is high enough, then the braai is a success; but if the satisfaction gets too low, then the player loses.</p><p>My partner and I decided to explore two genres that we had very little experience in: simulation and first-person games. As such, we defined four design goals for the project, all of which revolved around refining our simulation and first person game design skills. Firstly, we wanted our game to have smooth and intuitive controls. While crucial in every game, we emphasized this feature to try and alleviate simulation sickness, a motion sickness effect I suffer from that makes first-person games extremely challenging to play. Secondly, we wanted the game to have simple and appealing visuals. This would ensure that every aspect of the game was as clear and understandable as possible. Thirdly, we also wanted simple and effective tutorial guidance and feedback design so that the player could easily and intuitively be immersed in the act of braaiing. Lastly, our final design goal was to make sure that players experience a sense of pressure to complete orders. This pressure was created through the micromanagement of the foods being cooked and fulfilling orders efficiently.</p><h2 class="portfolio-page-heading-1">2. Process</h2><p>With that, we can then begin to look at the process behind Braai Simulator – using the four design goals as success criteria:</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.1. Smooth, and Intuitive, Controls</h3><p>As noted earlier, not only were we inexperienced when it came to developing first person games, but I suffer from simulation sickness and struggle to play first person games all together. Thus, we began development by focusing on creating a smooth first-person character controller – one that was intuitive to use and alleviated simulation sickness as much as possible. To do this, we researched the reasons behind what causes simulation sickness, noting down four main causes – cluttered visuals, wide fields of view, unrealistic movement speeds and inertia, and fast cursor speeds. So, by adjusting these values, where possible, we landed on a character controller that felt smooth and responsive to use for as many players as possible.</p><p>With the character controller finished, we then moved on to the main mechanic of the game – picking up utensils and using them to cook food. While we had originally developed this pick-up mechanic as very lose and free, allowing the player to pick up and drop any item at will, early playtests revealed that this was not enjoyable to use as players found it both unrealistic and chaos inducing – as utensils and food could be dropped anywhere, resulting in the player losing them, having to spend time looking for them unnecessarily. As such, it took away from the micromanagement aspect of the game, which forms a crucial part of our design goal on creating a sense of pressure for the player (as discussed in the next section). Thus, we began exploring alternative controls for the pickup mechanic, in the hopes of better aligning with our design goals. First, we considered giving the player a utensil wheel, which would hold all utensils – allowing the player to easily swap between them at a click of a button. However, we quickly realized that having an item that interacts with the game world, but can disappear in an instant, raised several design questions – such as what happens to food being held by utensils when swapping between them; or what happens when picking up plated food in the game world, is it swappable with utensils? Thus, we instead decided to find a middle ground between both approaches – landing on the idea that as opposed to food and utensils being freely placeable, or always on the player; food would only be placeable on clearly marked countertops in the gameworld. This approach then both alleviated the unrealistic methods of the original controls, while simultaneously giving the player a clear view of where their utensils were at all times – aiding the micromanagement aspect of the game.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.2. A Sense of Pressure to Complete Orders</h3><p>Thereafter, we can look at how we implemented the next design goal – a sense of pressure to complete orders. While there are elements that indirectly effect this, which are referenced throughout the rest of this paper, there are also direct items that affect this – mainly in terms of system design and balancing. In the game, there are various elements that have had to be adjusted in order to create a good sense of pressure for the player: the number of meats that can be cooked at once, how quickly guests arrive; how quickly food orders come in, how many plates are available, how quickly meat cooks, how much the satisfaction increases/decreases, and more. However, adjusting these values has been challenging – as every player has a different skillset and level. As such, through the use of extensive playtesting with our target audience – novice to intermediate gamers experiencing the game for the first time – we were then able to adjust the values to create an experience that we believe successfully creates a sense of pressure for completing orders when the player meets our target audience.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">2.3. Simple and Effective Tutorialization, UI, and Feedback</h3><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">2.3.1. Tutorialization</h4><p>Furthermore, we can then begin looking at the how we facilitated our design goal of simple and effective, tutorialization, UI, and feedback – starting by looking at how this design goal has been adjusted in response to playtesting. While originally this design goal revolved around natural, as opposed to simple and effective, tutorialization and UI, where the player naturally discovered the rules; playtesting quickly revealed that this was problematic, as players never fully understood the game – resulting in it conflicting with our design goal of creating a sense of pressure through micromanagement, as this pressure was being undermined by confusion. Thus, it was decided that instead of the design goal revolving around a natural tutorial, it would revolve around a simplistic, and concise, tutorial. As such, when looking at the tutorial that we implemented, we can see that the game only officially starts after it has completed – allowing players to explore all the mechanics fully before they start, giving new players an equal skill level. In addition, this then also made balancing the game much easier, as players are assumed to start at a similar skillset as opposed to an unknown skillset.</p><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">2.3.2. User Interface</h4><p>Next, we can look at the user interface – starting with the static UI. Looking at the screenshot in figure 1 below, the static, on-screen, UI consists of two elements that stick out – the satisfaction gauge, and the time of day. While the satisfaction gauge could have easily been text, like the time of day, we chose to represent it through the gauge as players did not need to know the exact value of satisfaction, and as such text would have overwhelmed them with unnecessary data. Through the use of a gauge, and colour theory (where red indicates low satisfaction, and green indicates high satisfaction), the player is then still able to understand the overall game satisfaction without actually looking at the UI – allowing the UI to be as unobtrusive as possible, and increasing the micromanagement as the player can focus on more information at once.</p><figure class="portfolio-figure single-card"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/Image1.064c285c1a098fe0b05a.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Figure 1: Screenshot showcasing the game’s User Interface</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, we can then look to the diegetic UI present in the game. While there was always diegetic UI planned, specifically in the form of food orders above guests’ heads, there have been various other additions and changes to the Diegetic UI as a result of playtesting. Although a diegetic clipboard, that the player would pick up like an item, that showed current orders was planned since the beginning of the game, playtesting revealed that this was redundant, as it was easier to look back and see the guests as opposed to dropping a utensil and picking up the clipboard. As such, we decided to make the clipboard static item on the wall, which players can easily see just to the left of the braai – helping them to further optimize their strategy and micromanagement. Although, there are also unplanned diegetic UI elements that greatly added to the game – such as food cooking markers. Through playtesting, we noted that players did not have enough information regarding food cooking times, making micromanaging the food more difficult. As such, diegetic markers were added above the food, displaying a circle timer that indicates the cooking/burning time for each food – changing colour to reflect the cooking state of the food (black for uncooked, yellow for half cooked, green for fully cooked, red for burnt).</p><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">2.3.3. Audio & Feedback</h4><p>Looking at the audio design of the game, this has also been greatly improved since its original inception. Early playtest results showed that there were multiple areas where players expected audio feedback, which we had not accounted for – such as picking up, stacking, and putting down plates; picking up tools; interacting with guests; cooking food; and more. As such, we incorporated all of this and found it greatly enhanced the gameplay experience.</p><p>However, the audio does not stop at just being used for feedback, as diegetic audio has also been implemented. Firstly, there is diegetic background music coming out of the radio in the gazebo. Although, unlike a standard background music track, this track increases in speed as the game progresses – psychologically tricking the players into moving faster and more fluidly. Secondly, diegetic audio feedback was also added to indicate satisfaction levels in addition to the meter. This can be seen through the sound that plays for the guests chatting, which changes to a chatting sound consisting of angry boos whenever satisfaction levels drop too low (halfway through the orange) and change back to the regular chatting sound if the satisfaction level is increased again. This then helps the player become more immersed in the game and feel the sense of pressure from guests to complete orders.</p><h2 class="portfolio-page-heading-1">3. Reflection</h2><p>Lastly, we can now reflect on the final game that was created. Overall, through the process that I outlined above, I believe that my partner and I were able to successfully meet the design goals of a first-person game with smooth and intuitive controls; simple and appealing visuals; and a simple and effective tutorial, UI, and feedback. However, while I believe that we reached the goal of creating a sense of pressure for the player through micromanaging, it could be debated that we did not – as we are acutely aware that the balancing of elements could have been refined even further. Nonetheless, I can still take this knowledge forward into all future games, expanding our skillset to include first person, and simulation, games. Not only that, but this game showed the importance of playtesting and balancing values, which is something that will be useful to take forward – even outside of simulation games. However, this game was merely a starting point for a potentially much larger project – where there could be more levels, different locations, and additional food types and preparations to prepare – but because that would require additional balancing, playtesting, and time, we were unable to do that that.</p></section></article></article></main><footer class="main-footer h-card"><section class="main-footer-contents"><p class="p-name">Michael Parkin</p><p>|</p><time datetime="2023">2023</time></section><section class="secondary-footer-contents"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-parkin-a43349169/" target="_blank"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" data-testid="LinkedInIcon" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h14m-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93h2.79M6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37h2.77z"></path></svg></a></section></footer></div></body></html>
