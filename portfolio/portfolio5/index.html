You go out and decide to take your car, only to discover there is only on-street parking available. When arriving there is nothing to worry about ‚Äì you find an open parking spot, park, lock your car, and go on your way. However, upon arriving back at your car later, it quickly becomes a different story. You see, just as you‚Äôre about to leave, an informal ‚Äòcar guard‚Äô appears out of nowhere ‚Äì claiming to have been watching your car the entire time, soliciting for money in return. So, what do you do? You get in your car, pull out some spare change in your pocket, give it to the car guard, and go on your way so as not to cause any awkward encounters. What should have been a simple in and out process, becomes an almost stressful, and potentially awkward, game of cat and mouse.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem</h3><p class="problem-text"><b>How can we improve the overall on-street parking experience in South Africa, making it a more seamless and safer environment for everyone involved?</b></p><p>For the most part these self-proclaimed 'car guards' are unreliable, intoxicated, and often offer very little actual protection against car theft. In fact, their presence often times actually leads to a more unsafe situation ‚Äì especially for female drivers travelling alone at night, where a creepy man appearing out of nowhere, confronting you, is not safe nor comforting. It raises the question of what happens if you don't have change to give them? Or are they really a car guard? It is a problem unique to South Africa, and as such one unexplored.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">üí° The Solution</h3><p>After multiple iterations and user testing sessions, the idea of creating an <b class="bio-bold">app-based platform</b>, for mobile devices, that <b class="bio-bold">connects drivers directly to on-street parking guards</b> was chosen. This ultimately makes the process of on-street parking in South Africa much more convenient and safer for everyone.</p><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">üé• Demo Video</h3><section class="video-container"><iframe class="video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZ9O5MSITwk" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" frameborder="0" title="video"></iframe></section><h2 class="portfolio-page-heading-1">Details</h2><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">üé® Design Process</h3><p>The project can be divided into <b class="bio-bold">four main areas</b> based on the double-diamond design process. The following graphic gives an overview of the steps and tasks involved in each one.</p><figure class="portfolio-figure single-card"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/DoubleDiamond-test.b7013b12ded5b8ce6670.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Double diamond diagram showing design process</figcaption></figure><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Discover</h3><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">Stakeholder Analysis</h4><p class="sub-head-p">Firstly, including all possible stakeholders in the design process is essential to create the best suitable design for all party's involved. As such, below is an illustrated account of all the stakeholders and their relationship to one another. In this case, there are two main stakeholders: <b class="bio-bold">drivers</b>, who are the primary target user of the app, seeking a safer and more convenient on-street parking experience; and <b class="bio-bold">on-street parking guards</b>, those who use the app to connect with drivers, providing their services and receiving compensation in a more organized and transparent manner.</p><figure class="portfolio-figure single-card"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/StakeholderDiagram-test.11da3cc71e2890af8463.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Stakeholder diagram showing the primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders</figcaption></figure><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">User Needs Research</h4><p class="sub-head-p">To better understand how to improve the on-street parking experience in South Africa, I conducted a comprehensive user research employing both <b class="bio-bold">surveys</b> and <b class="bio-bold">semi-structured interviews</b>. The primary objective with this was to better understand the unique challenges faced by drivers in South Africa.</p><p class="sub-head-p">I started the user research with <b class="bio-bold">surveys</b> aimed at capturing a broad understanding of the prevailing issues with on-street parking in South Africa. To do this, I was able to reach 42 participants from diverse backgrounds and regions within South Africa, with the goal of understanding the frequency and nature of interactions with informal 'car guards.' Key survey questions explored the perceived safety concerns, reliability of these guards, and the impact on the overall parking experience. The responses were analyzed and findings are discussed further down in the findings section.</p><p class="sub-head-p">Next, recognizing the limitations of surveys in capturing nuanced experiences and sentiments, I conducted a number of <b class="bio-bold">in-depth semi-strcutured interviews</b> to delve deeper into the qualitative aspects of the on-street parking scenario. Through this, I engaged with a group of 4 participants, including frequent drivers and female drivers who often travel alone at night. The interviews unveiled a series of emotional and experiential dimensions of the problem, which I go into more depth in my findings section later.</p><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">Competitive Analysis</h4><p class="sub-head-p">After looking through the research data, which focused on the on-street parking experiences in general, I performed a competitive analysis of other parking services and systems in South Africa. While I considered looking at similair international services, I decided that given the cultural differences that it would not be worthwhile. All of this then resulted in three competitors being identified in the space at the time: two off-street parking services, <b class="bio-bold">KaChing</b> and <b class="bio-bold">Admyt</b>; and one on-street parking service, <b class="bio-bold">ParkFind</b>.</p><p class="sub-head-p">Having performed a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Oppurtunities, Threats) analysis of these competitors, it can be noted that none of these apps or services have take off in South Africa. This can mainly be attributed to one problem: they add an extra step of complexity to the parking process, as opposed to simplifying it. All of the currently available solutions try to provide a solution to a problem that never really existed. For example, with off-street parking KaChing & Admyt both advertise ‚Äòticketless entry‚Äô at parking bays - where instead of taking a ticket the service uses AI cameras to admit you upon approaching the parking lot. However, these cameras are often broken, requiring the driver to take a ticket nonetheless - adding another thing for the driver to worry about. With the on-street parking app ParkFind, it has some major flaws. Instead of trying to revolutionise on-street parking, its actual goal was merely to modernise parking meters. As such, it takes all the headaches that parking meters present ‚Äî having to pre-emptively choose your parking duration, limited parking hours, and pre-existing equipment required ‚Äî and links that to a mobile application. Thus, through a competitive analysis we can see that there is still a large amount of room to grow and explore.</p><figure class="portfolio-figure single-card"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/SWOT-test.ae4330a7a2feeade8e70.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>A SWOT diagram of all the parking service competitors in South Africa</figcaption></figure><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">üéØ Define</h3><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">Findings</h4><figure class="portfolio-figure-long"><img class="portfolio-image-long u-photo" src="/static/media/Test.4f3eb265806a43ef3329.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"></figure><p class="sub-head-p">From the research performed, there is clearly a pressing need for innovation in the on-street parking landscape in South Africa. Users crave a solution that not only ensures safety and reliability but also addresses the emotional impact of the current system. The integration of a cashless transaction system, enhanced safety measures, and a user-friendly interface emerged as key priorities for improving the on-street parking experience in South Africa. These insights will guide the development of a solution that aligns with the unique needs and challenges faced by drivers in the region.</p><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">Design Requirements</h4><p class="sub-head-p">Through these findings, three high-level design requirements were developed to ensure high relevance to the goal that is trying to be achieved:</p><ul class="portfolio-bullet-cont"><li class="portfolio-bullet">The solution should <b class="bio-bold">provide a sense of safety to the user</b>, knowing who is looking after their car at all times</li><li class="portfolio-bullet">Users should be able to <b class="bio-bold">rely on a digital payment method</b>, alleviating cash and the potential unknown cost of parking</li><li class="portfolio-bullet">Parking guards should have <b class="bio-bold">appropriate training and skills</b>, making sure that they are a reliable guard for your car</li></ul><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">üõ†Ô∏è Develop</h3><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">Ideation & Final Decision</h4><p class="sub-head-p">Based on the research and design requirements listed, I then performed a brainstorming session on FigJam to develop potential solutions to this problem - which can be seen below. Thereafter, I went through each idea and tried to combine, and filter them into the best ones. From this, I then ultimately landed on the idea of <b class="bio-bold">creating a SaaS application that connects drivers to verified on-street car guards.</b></p><iframe class="portfolio-figma" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FxkgKGLBPjnOdr1ZN3wh6y0%2FBrainstorm-crazy-8s-(Community)%3Ftype%3Dwhiteboard%26node-id%3D0%253A1%26t%3DbgV1pamu5fdx1iQP-1" height="650" width="800"></iframe><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">User Journey</h4><p class="sub-head-p">With a design solution chosen, I then went on to develop a standard user journey for the driver in order to better understand how a user might use it.</p><figure class="portfolio-figure single-card"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/UserJourney.79431820ac2837f9db05.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Stakeholder diagram showing the primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders</figcaption></figure><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">Design Language</h4><p class="sub-head-p">Thereafter, I went on to create a design language for the application - ensuring its style is minimalist and easy to understand.</p><figure class="portfolio-figure single-card"><img class="portfolio-image u-photo" src="/static/media/Styleguide.6475affc09c874fb3492.png" alt="A missing image with squares of different colours" height="1000" title="This is a missing image" width="1000"><figcaption>Stakeholder diagram showing the primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders</figcaption></figure><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">Wireframes & Prototype</h4><p class="sub-head-p">Using Figma, I then developed a series of low-fidelity wireframes for the driver application. It is important to note that like other SaaS applications, Parker requires a customer (the driver) and provider (the car guard) applications, but <b class="bio-bold">for the sake of scope this project focuses solely on the customer side.</b>I then used these low-fidelity wireframes, along with feedback sessions to develop a set of high-fidelity wireframes. Thereafter, Swift & SwiftUI were used to turn those high-fidelity wireframes into a working prototype, which was seen working in the video earlier. These can be seen alongside each other in an interactable Figma window below.</p><section class="portfolio-double-figures"><iframe class="portfolio-figma double" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FltOD8UKv7IThncGx7LzEBH%2FParker-(Client)-Wireframes%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D118%253A10404%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3D5rcobC87ZrjCVNMU-1" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe><iframe class="portfolio-figma double" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FltOD8UKv7IThncGx7LzEBH%2FParker-(Client)-Wireframes%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D345%253A11956%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3D5rcobC87ZrjCVNMU-1" height="500px" width="100%"></iframe></section><h3 class="portfolio-page-heading-2">‚úÖ Deliver</h3><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">User Testing</h4><p class="sub-head-p">In a discounted evaluation, I made use of <b class="bio-bold">task-based testing</b>, alongside a <b class="bio-bold">semi-structured interview</b> to test my design solution and prototype. I conducted all of the tests with 2 participants in their mid 20s. All participants had a driver's license and were familair with the problem space. Throughout testing, I also asked users to <b class="bio-bold">think aloud</b>. The <b class="bio-bold">task scenarios</b> used to test this were:</p><ul class="portfolio-bullet-cont"><li class="portfolio-bullet">Imagine you are out and have used on-street parking. How would you check your current parking time and cost?<br><b class="bio-bold">Rationale:</b> The first task scenario aims to cover the primary purpose of the app, seeing if users know and understand how to perform one of its main actions.</li><li class="portfolio-bullet">Imagine you are have just gotten home after using on-street parking and want to rate your car guard, how would you do this?<br><b class="bio-bold">Rationale:</b> After completing the primary function, I wanted to test the users ability to find previous parking sessions.</li></ul><h4 class="portfolio-page-heading-3">Reflection & Suggestions</h4><p class="sub-head-p">Overall, I believe that through the process outlined above, I was able to land on an innovative solution to a problem that is evident on a daily basis to South African drivers. While I am happy with the solution the implementation I came up with, during final user testing there were a handful of suggestions given for further improvement. These include:</p><ul class="portfolio-bullet-cont"><li class="portfolio-bullet"><b class="bio-bold">Diversify User Testing Demographics:</b> While the discounted evaluation provides valuable feedback, consider expanding the user testing pool to include a more diverse demographic, ensuring a broader representation of potential users. This could uncover additional insights and perspectives that may influence the final design.</li><li class="portfolio-bullet"><b class="bio-bold">Improve Visual Design Language:</b> While users noted the app was easy to use and presented a minimalist aesthetic, they advised designing a visual design language that was more unique and had its own brand identity.</li><li class="portfolio-bullet"><b class="bio-bold">Integrate More Deeply with Private Security Companies:</b> In South Africa, private security companies are extremely popular. Users would have liked to see a deeper integration with these companies when a car guard is watching their vehicle.</li></ul></section></article></article></div></div></main><footer class="main-footer h-card"><section class="main-footer-contents"><p class="p-name">Michael Parkin</p><p>|</p><time datetime="2023">2023</time></section><section class="secondary-footer-contents"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-parkin-a43349169/" target="_blank"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="MuiSvgIcon-root MuiSvgIcon-fontSizeMedium css-vubbuv" data-testid="LinkedInIcon" focusable="false" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H5a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V5a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h14m-.5 15.5v-5.3a3.26 3.26 0 0 0-3.26-3.26c-.85 0-1.84.52-2.32 1.3v-1.11h-2.79v8.37h2.79v-4.93c0-.77.62-1.4 1.39-1.4a1.4 1.4 0 0 1 1.4 1.4v4.93h2.79M6.88 8.56a1.68 1.68 0 0 0 1.68-1.68c0-.93-.75-1.69-1.68-1.69a1.69 1.69 0 0 0-1.69 1.69c0 .93.76 1.68 1.69 1.68m1.39 9.94v-8.37H5.5v8.37h2.77z"></path></svg></a></section></footer></div><script src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-EJ4SX3B6EQ" async></script></body></html>
